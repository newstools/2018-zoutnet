Mafunzwaini (63) of Block A in Sibasa, passed away last Wednesday (18 July) in a hospital in Pretoria after a long illness. King Mphephu-Ramabulana said that he was saddened by the passing away of Mafunzwaini, because he was a trusted and dedicated aid with huge knowledge of chieftainship issues. “He used to advise us well with all the chieftainship problems in a dignified manner. He left us while we were still in need  ofmore information and research on chieftain disputes and resolutions,” he added. Family spokesperson Ms Thelma Marole said life would never be the same after Mafunzwaini’s passing. She said Mafunzwaini, who received professional teacher's training, taught only for one year in 1979 at Tshiheni Primary School.

His Azwi Development Agency, which focuses on social issues and traditional affairs, honoured the President of the Republic of Venda, Khosikhulu Patrick Ramaano Mphephu, by hosting a memorial lecture,” said Marole. The agency also honoured several South African statesmen, irrespective of political affiliation.
