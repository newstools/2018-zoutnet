News - Date: 28 July 2018 Written by: Elmon Tshikhudo / Viewed: 533 Newly installed traditional leader Thovhele Vhambelani Thavha Maano Netsianda is fast endearing himself to his people. The youthful leader has already shown that he really needs development in his area. He took over the reins at his village not too long ago, but he is bringing much-needed development change at great speed. Not long ago, to show his passion for education, he rewarded hardworking learners from five schools through his Back to School Campaign programme. He also reinforced his governance by appointing a new council to assist him in his day-to-day work. Netsianda said as a new leader he still needed a lot of support and advice to run his vast village. "We need development here and that can only be achieved if there is proper governance. With this new council, which has young and experienced elders, we hope we will achieve that.” Members who comprise the traditional council are as follows: Mr Fulufhelo  Mulaudzi (chairperson), Mr Phalanndwa Mulaudzi (deputy chairperson ), Ms Rendani Ramuluvhana (secretary), Mr Aifheli Laurence Dombo (deputy secretary), Ms Lucy Munyai  (treasurer)  and Mr Azwinndini Bryce Madala as chief adviser to Thovhele Netsianda.
