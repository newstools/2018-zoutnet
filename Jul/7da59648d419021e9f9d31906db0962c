One of the beneficiaries, Miss Confidence Ngobeni, said that her life and those of her three siblings were going to change for the better. "I am happy that the municipality took us out of an isolated life. We lived in fear with my two brothers and sister because when it rained the whole house became flooded. I am thankful for the intervention of our government and ward councilor, Mr Dorgen Ndove, who made it possible for us to have a better house to call home," said Ngobeni. Ndove promised to deliver better services and fulfil the needs of the disadvantaged people in the community.
