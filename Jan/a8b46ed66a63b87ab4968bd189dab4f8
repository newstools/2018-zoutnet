News - Date: 27 January 2018 Written by:  / Viewed: 132 Mr Enock “Mapepa” Singo of Nancefield in Musina will always be remembered as a loving and courageous disabled man who would not even hurt a fly. Unfortunately, his life was cut short a fortnight ago when he fell ill. He was laid to rest in Musina last weekend. An active member of Musina Disability Forum, Singo took part in various initiatives aimed at advancing the lives of disabled people within the Musina Municipal area until his last day on earth. Musina Mayor Mihloti Muhlope described the death of Singo as a huge loss to the community of Musina. “He has always been there when we initiate plans for the disabled people of Musina. His memories will always remain in our minds. He has played a major role in the development of the Musina Disability Forum.” The mayor urged other disabled people to learn from Singo’s life. “Although we are mourning, we are happy that Singo has contributed to what the Musina Disability Forum is today. Our deep sympathy is with the grieving family during these difficult times.” Yunsa Mbewe of the Musina Disability Forum said it was painful to lose one of their dedicated members. “We are all very sad. He was a member of our big family and it pains us to part ways with him forever. We felt it was very important for us to hold a memorial service in his honour before his burial. We will always remember him as a pioneer of Musina Disability Forum.” Mr Enock “Mapepa” Singo.  Email:
