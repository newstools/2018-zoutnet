News - Date: 22 January 2018 Written by: Kaizer Nengovhela / Viewed: 291 Community members, family and ANC Women’s League members came in large numbers to pay tribute to Ms Makwarela Masala (51), who was buried at Madombidzha on Saturday. Masala died last week at Louis Trichardt Memorial hospital after a short illness. All the speakers recognized the good work that Masala had done for the community as a leader and politician. A family representative, Mr Commie Masala, told the mourners that the family had accepted the loss although it was difficult to cope with it. Ms Maria Sithari from the ANC Women’s League said that although the family, friends and movement had accepted what had happened, it would be difficult to forget that this death had robbed the community of an energetic leader who had been full of zeal and courage. She said Masala would always be remembered for being the driver of opportunities within the communities where she had lived. “All we have to do is to give full support to the family to make sure that their loved one is given a dignified send-off. We are saddened by her untimely departure. The family has already suffered enough pain and we should always be there to comfort them.” She added that, instead of constantly shedding tears, "we must also go down memory lane and remember the good things that Masala did for this community while she was still alive".
