News - Date: 11 January 2018 Written by: Elmon Tshikhudo / Viewed: 224 Sixty child-headed and disadvantaged families at Itsani started the new year on a high note, when a well-known Shayandima-based business presented them with food parcels. The parcels came about as an initiative by Thulamela Ward 37 councillor Mr Takalani Mawelewele and other stakeholders, who went out seeking donations for them. Out of the many requests they made, Naledzi Lodge at Shayandima responded positively and catered for all the families. Cllr Mawelewele said that they had a big challenge in the ward, as most families were headed by children and were poor with no one working in the family. "As the leadership, we cannot pretend that nothing is happening when children are starving. We know we cannot go out begging on their behalf and that is why we started a self-sustainable project to help them. The little they got today will brighten their faces and they will enjoy themselves with others," she said. Ms Margareth Makhado, manager at Naledzi Lodge, said that when they were approached they did not think twice as it was a worthy cause. "Children have a special place in this company. We strongly believe that the future of this country lies with the youth,” she said. Some of the beneficiaries with the groceries they received from Naledzi Lodge at Shayandima.
