News - Date: 22 January 2018 Written by: Elmon Tshikhudo / Viewed: 376 Giving birth to a disabled child became a turning point in the life of Ms Rabelani Khumbelo. The 31-year-old hardworking and dedicated woman from Muledane Mvudi Park in Thohoyandou gave birth to a disabled child in 2013. The child died the following year. What she went through because of the child gave her a better understanding of disability and the need to assist those with disabilities, she said. With 11 others who had the same vision, she formed an organization, Care Giver Foundation. The organisation is already making its presence felt in the community. They have partnered with the Diiteleni Day Care Centre at Tshisahulu outside Thohoyandou. "Our first task at the centre was to evaluate the needs of the disabled and we found that they need serious assistance. We have gone all out to solicit resources and hope something positive will come out of the many doors we have knocked on. We are appealing to those with open hearts to assist.” Ms Rabelani Khumbelo, one of the founding members, said that children were a gift from God, “especially the disabled who cannot do more on their own and need help.” She further indicated that they needed mattresses for the children, wall paint, educational products, blankets and wheelchairs for 11 children. Those wishing to assist can do so by phoning Ms Khumbelo at 079 687 2229. Some of the executive members of the Care Giver Foundation.  Elmon Tshikhudo started off as a photographer.
