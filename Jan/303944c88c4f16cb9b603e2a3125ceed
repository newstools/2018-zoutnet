Basopa is in the Malalmulele North East circuit of education. The school managed an 82,7% pass rate of the 116 pupils who wrote their matric last year. During the event, Kubayi-Ngubane told the pupils that coming from a disadvantaged background or coming from a rural area should not be a barrier for them in achieving their goals. “I used to stay in a shack and I managed to pass my matric with flying colours,” she said. “It doesn’t matter where you come from; if you want to become something, you can become something.” She advised students to work towards university exemption. “If you want to become a doctor, you need a bachelor’s pass,” she added.” She also promised students of Basopa High that if a learner obtained three distinctions, she would pay for his or her tuition fees, accommodation and food. The event was attended by Hosi Shilungwa Mhinga II and Cllr Henry Chauke of the Collins Chabane Municipality.
