The disabled Gogo Sarinah Tlou and her family are sharing living and sleeping conditions in a dilapidated shack with no proper floor. The roof of the house is also threatening to fall in on the inhabitants of the house. During the launch of the building process, Tshidavhu expressed her pride at being part of the “good deed aimed at uplifting the community.” She stated that most of the families in the area were unemployed people and they needed assistance from the community. “They did not choose to be poor, and they need to be uplifted by those who can do something for them,” she said. She appealed to other community members to assist the poor in the development of society and mentioned that the donation was based on love and brotherhood. The disabled Tlou thanked the donor who recognized her need. She said that she and her family appreciated the assistance of Ms Tshidavhu and the rest of the community.
