A huge tombstone in honour of Nethononda was unveiled during the funeral.

We will be indebted to her forever," he said. Matamba Nethononda was born in 1950. She was the fourth child of the late Ms Munzhedzi and Mr John Matamba. She is survived by her eight children, 21 grandchildren, five great-grandchildren and other relatives.
