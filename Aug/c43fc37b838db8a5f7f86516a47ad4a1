Muhlope was addressing family members, employees from Musina Municipality, members of ward committees and representatives of various stakeholders who converged to pay their last respects to the deceased during an emotional memorial service held at Nancefield Community Hall last Friday. Makhado was a member of the Musina Municipality's ward committee in Ward 3. An active member of the ANC, Makhado was also fully involved with the Musina Community Safety Forum and various community development initiatives in his community. Muhlope said there was no municipality that could operate effectively without functional ward committees. “Makhado’s passing means that our ward committees will now be weakened because we lost a loyal and hardworking member. He left a void that will be very difficult to fill.” She sent condolences to Makhado’s family, friends and all those who had the pleasure of knowing him. “On behalf of the Council of Musina Municipality and the entire community, we are mourning with the family during this difficult time.” Ntshumeni Manngwe, who represented the deceased’s family, thanked the Musina Municipality for the support provided. “Although we are mourning, you comforted us because you have always been there for us when we needed you most. You have really displayed humanity, love and compassion. We hope you will display the same support to all other families who are in the same situation as us.” Makhado was laid to rest on Saturday at Muswodi-Tshisimani village.
