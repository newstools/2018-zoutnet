News - Date: 03 August 2018 Written by: Silas Nduvheni / Viewed: 1581 The late advisor of King Toni Mphephu-Ramabulana, Mr Jackson Langanani Mafunzwaini, was described as a gallant fighter of the institution of traditional leadership in South Africa. He was buried on Saturday after a ceremony in the Christ Worship Centre (CWC) in Manini. “Mafunzwaini was a man of few words, decisive, dedicated and of course he was also very persistent. He upheld the values and cultural practices of the kingship, and he defended these values until his last day on the earth,” said former director-general of traditional affairs prof Charles Nwaila. Nwaila said that one of the things that he would always remember was Mafunzwaini’s ability to harmonize the relationship between the elected leadership in municipalities and traditional leaders. King Toni Mphephu-Ramabulana said he was saddened by the passing away of the man he trusted in championing the issues of traditional leadership. According to him, Mafunzwaini taught him to rule his communities truthfully and in a dignified manner. Mphephu-Ramabulana also used the event to lash out to people who continued to use social media as a platform of disrespecting the kingship and traditional leadership. He said there was nothing he was hiding regarding the reports about the VBS scandal. He instructed that those found guilty of any transgression must face the might of the law, regardless of their position and status. The MEC for Co-operative Governance, Human Settlements and Traditional Affairs, Mr Jerry Ndou, said they had lost a friend and administrator. He promised to work well with the office of the King. Mafunzwaini (63) of Sibasa, Block A passed away on 18 July in a hospital in Pretoria after a long illness. He is survived by his wife, Mmbambadzeni, and five children.
