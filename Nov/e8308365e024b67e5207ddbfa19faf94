Mr George Magonya (80) was laid to rest at the Madabani Cemetery on Saturday. He died after a long illness in the Louis Trichardt Memorial Hospital a fortnight ago. He was a member of the Zion Christian Church (ZCC). During the ceremony, Mr Scara Tshigomana described Magonya as no ordinary churchgoer but as a true Christian. He said the community and family had lost one of its pillars, who had always been working hard towards the development of the community through his skills. Tshigomana said that Magonya used his art as a medium to engage with the community on issues that affected them and the cultural direction that society took. He made it a point that Magonya’s art did not end with the mere creation of objects, but he used his objects to stimulate further engagement with the audience, Tshigomana said. The deceased’s grandson, Mr Rofhiwa Magonya, said that the family was in mourning after losing one of their beloved members, but that they were very proud to have produced a man such as Magonya. He described Magonya as a community builder who was larger than life. “He was always there whenever we needed him. He was a responsible grandfather, who also worked hard in the development of sculpting in the community,” he added.  Family and church members carry the coffin of Mr George Magonya.
