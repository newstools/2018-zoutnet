After the fun walk, community members and stakeholders converged at Skoonplaas Stadium where a formal programme unfolded. Sakala said he was happy that people from Musina had joined the world in commemoration of this important day. “The fact that you have decided to put everything aside to come and attend, displays that you care about the health of our society. We are very thankful that here in Musina we have people like you who take their health very seriously.” He emphasized that if the nation was healthy, it entailed a productive community that would be able to take the country forward. Sakala urged those who do not suffer from diabetes to continue living a healthy life. He said those who were diabetic should live a positive life because it was not the end of the world. “People do not know that they can live with diabetes for a very long time if they adopt a healthy lifestyle. The most important thing is to take your medication as directed by health practitioners, while at the same time doing exercise and eating healthy. If you follow all this, you will live a normal life, even though you suffer from diabetes.” He encouraged those who took part in the fun walk to continue exercising daily. “Exercising should be part of your daily life and it should not end here today. There are many benefits of staying strong. When you exercise continuously, you reduce the chances of being attacked by opportunistic diseases. Besides that, a person who exercises has the chance of living longer than the one who doesn’t.”  Community members exercise during the World Diabetes Day at Skoonplaas Stadium, Musina.  Email:
