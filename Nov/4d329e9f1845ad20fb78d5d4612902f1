News - Date: 18 November 2018 Written by: Elmon Tshikhudo / Viewed: 354 The murders of young people at liquor outlets in Vhembe villages have not only become a source for concern for the police, but parents are equally disturbed. In a shocking incident, a 19-year-old woman allegedly stabbed her 25-year-old boyfriend to death during a drinking spree at a tavern at Mbilwi outside Thohoyandou. The incident took place last weekend. The circumstances leading to the killing are still sketchy, but information at the paper’s disposal indicates that the two were with other patrons when an argument ensued. The woman allegedly took out a sharp object and stabbed her partner. “The police and the medical emergency services swiftly responded after they were summoned to the scene. The injured man was taken to the local hospital, where he was certified dead on arrival. The police immediately launched a manhunt until the suspect was arrested when she handed herself to the police," said Col Moatshe Ngoepe, the Limpopo police’s spokesperson. She will appear in the Thohoyandou Magistrate's Court soon. Community leader Thikhathali Nndanganeni expressed alarm at the incident. "As a village we are still in shock. This is the time for examinations, and the youth are supposed to be writing. It is quite saddening to find that young people are dying at liquor outlets, and losing young people is like losing the future of the country," said Nndanganeni. He also urged young people not to frequent liquor outlets but to focus on their studies.   Elmon Tshikhudo started off as a photographer.
