A teacher by profession, Randima said he and his khoro would not hesitate to take strong disciplinary action against those who ignored his warning. He said it was important to give school children support and a conducive environment when they wrote their examinations. “This is the most important time of the year for our kids, and we should all make sure that they write their examinations freely. Remember, these kids have been working very hard since January and we should not disturb them at the eleventh hour. We should all adopt the saying that it takes a whole village to raise a child. My child is your child and your child is mine. Everything that we do should be aimed at empowering them, so that they can pass their examinations with ease.” Randima said he had already received complaints about people who played loud music at night. “This has been brought to my attention by concerned parents and it is important that, as a leader, I should take corrective measures to address the situation. We have also learnt that, in some instances, intoxicated people sing very loud at night when they are heading to their homes. This highly disturbs children who are studying, and it cannot be tolerated.” He said the importance of education for any village was clear. “I am happy that we have many professionals in my village. This is because they have taken education seriously by studying hard during difficult times. If we have more educated people in our village, life will be easier and our community will develop. Besides that, education lowers unemployment and brings light to any nation.”  Musanda Vho-Mmbangiseni Randima.  Email:
