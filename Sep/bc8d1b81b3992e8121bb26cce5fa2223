News - Date: 21 September 2018 Written by: Elmon Tshikhudo / Viewed: 1461 Well-known Limpopo boxer Tsiko "Cruel Junior" Mulovhedzi was arrested at the weekend for allegedly driving under the influence of alcohol. The one-time boxing champion, who was accused in 2015 of using muti to beat the much-favoured Ali Funeka in East London, was arrested when police were doing a routine drunk-driving check. The incident happened in Thohoyandou on Friday evening. The boxer, who had not fought for 11 months, was recently given a chance to fight Swiss boxer Zino Mueli. Mueli defeated him for the WBF welterweight title. A breathalyser was used, and he was allegedly found to have exceeded the allowed alcohol limit. Limpopo police spokesperson Col Moatshe Ngoepe confirmed the arrest, saying the boxer had been detained at around 19:30 after the police stopped and searched his vehicle during an operation. “He was then tested for his blood/alcohol level, using the alcohol blow device and was then arrested on the spot for drunken driving. He was released and did not appear before court, pending the result of a blood test," said Ngoepe. Tsiko "Cruel Junior" Mulovhedzi. Tsiko "Cruel Junior" Mulovhedzi. Tsiko "Cruel Junior" Mulovhedzi.
