News - Date: 08 September 2018 Written by: Mbulaheni Ridovhona / Viewed: 258 That time of the year, where learners must apply to secure their places at institutions of higher learning, has come around again.

In an effort to encourage learners to apply on time, the University of Venda (Univen), in partnership with the Mulenzhe Development Trust, recently held a career guidance and information day at the Mulenzhe Tribal Authority offices. During the event, learners were told to apply at Univen before the closing date of 28 September.

Prof Takalani Mashau from Univen's School of Education motivated learners about the importance of education as a key to success and curbing poverty. “You must read until it hurts, for you to have a bright future. In most cases you as learners fail because you consider rights without responsibility, business without ethics, science without humanity, politics without principles and education without heart,” Mashau said.

The learners were also encouraged to apply for bursaries and avoid depending on the National Student Financial Aid Scheme.

Other institutions that participated in the event were Vhembe Technical Vocational Education and Training College, the Transport Education Training Authority (TETA) and the Limpopo Department of Economic Development, Environment and Tourism. Grade 12 learners from Johannes Ramavhoya, Mukhwantheli and Movhe high schools listen to different speakers.  The 22-year-old Mbulaheni (Gary) Ridovhona has been passionate about journalism to the extent that he would buy himself a copy of weekly Univen students' newsletter, Our Voice. After reading, he would write stories about his rural village, Mamvuka, and submit them to the very newsletter for publication. His deep-rooted love for words and writing saw him register for a Bachelor of Arts in Media Studies at the University of Venda, and joined the Limpopo Mirror team in February 2016 as a journalism intern.
