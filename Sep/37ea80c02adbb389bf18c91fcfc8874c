News - Date: 27 September 2018 Written by: Elmon Tshikhudo / Viewed: 444 Concerned residents of Vhembe who are worried about the future of VBS are to march to highlight their plight. The demonstrators, led by the Thulamela Business Forum (TBF) together with Save VBS, SANCO subregion and other stakeholders, will march from VBS Thohoyandou to the Nedbank Game Centre in Thohoyandou. The demonstration starts at 09:45 on Saturday. The spokesperson for the TBF, Mr Justice Nedzamba, said the demonstration was an escalation of the resistance against Nedbank's facilitating VBS clients' accounts. He said it was prompted by the fact that the structures felt that Nedbank was not responding to their memorandum after their meeting, which was held at the Khoroni Conference Hall on 3 September, and subsequent e-mail communications between Nedbank and the TBF. He further indicated that Nedbank was facilitating VBS clients' accounts against the will of the community, thereby further inconveniencing the depositors. "As Thulamela Business Forum and all the other structures, we are of the view that Nedbank facilitating VBS clients’ accounts is seen as assisting to destroy VBS, which is the legacy of the black people and Vhavenda in particular,” said Mr Nedzamba. "It is against this background that the planned demonstration is going to take place," said Nedzamba.  Elmon Tshikhudo started off as a photographer.
