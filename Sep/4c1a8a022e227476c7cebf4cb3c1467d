News - Date: 01 September 2018 Written by:  / Viewed: 232 A senior traditional leader, Thovhele Vho-Mmbangiseni Manenzhe, has urged other traditional leaders to work closely with the government to develop their communities. Mananzhe was speaking shortly after the Musina Municipality's council meeting that was held in his area of jurisdiction, Ha-Manenzhe, last Thursday. Manenzhe is one of the senior traditional leaders who has been allocated a seat on the council of Musina Municipality. Manenzhe said he was impressed by the fact that the municipality had state-of-the-art facilities in Musina town but decided to hold their important meeting in a deeply rural village to interact with ordinary citizens. “It is important to work with our political leaders to bring services to our people. The municipality is the catalyst for service delivery and we as traditional leaders only provide land. If there is no cooperation between the municipality and traditional leaders, ordinary people suffer most, because they will not receive the much-needed services.” Musina Mayor Mihloti Muhlope said the visit continued to pave the way to create a platform to engage citizens on issues related to service delivery. “I’m happy because traditional leaders are taking our visits very seriously. Traditional leaders are one of our main stakeholders because a huge portion of land in our municipality belongs to them.” Muhlope said the council meetings would rotate to all senior traditional leaders who had a seat on the council of Musina Municipality.
