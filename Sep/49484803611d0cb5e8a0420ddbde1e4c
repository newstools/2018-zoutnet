Ms Sonto Ndlovu, chief executive officer of the Limpopo Tourism Agency, said that Limpopo was blessed with many heritage icons found nowhere else in the world. “Tourism is one of our most important sources of income for our province. It contributes to sustainable economic growth, job creation and poverty eradication,” she added. In referring to Tourism Month, she pledged support to the local, regional and provincial community. "What a pleasure if we offer hospitality and a crime-free holiday to our tourists,” she said. She warned local communities, however, that the way they treated their visitors would determine whether tourism would grow or not. She pleaded with the community not to mug tourists and not to hide perpetrators. “We need to continue to embrace and celebrate our African identity in its entirety.” LTA Board Chairperson Andrew Dipela said September was a month where all focus is intentionally placed on South Africa’s tourism sector and all the role players were recognised.
He stressed the fact that the tourism industry created entrepreneurial opportunities.
