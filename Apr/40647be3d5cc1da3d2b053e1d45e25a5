Police members, after receiving a tip-off from a member of the public, intervened just in time to stop the pangolin being sold to the illegal muti market. The suspects, two men aged 35 and 42, were found in possession of the pangolin late on Tuesday afternoon. The two suspects were driving a Toyota Hilux bakkie, that was also confiscated by the police during their arrest. They were parked near Checkers in the Anver Hadjee Noor Centre on the corner of Songozwi and Anderson Street. The pangolin found in their possession was still alive, and police believe that the suspects were about to sell it. Police investigations are still ongoing to determine where the two men caught the pangolin. Local police spokesperson Const Irene Radzilane, confirmed on Wednesday that the pangolin was handed over to the safety of the local environmental officers so that it could be released back into the wild. The two suspects were expected to appear in the Louis Trichardt Magistrate Court later in the week. The pangolin that police found when they arrested two suspects. Photo supplied.
