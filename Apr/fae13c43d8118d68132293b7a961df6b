Ramathuba was speaking during the launch of the #Office Must Fall campaign at Letaba Hospital two weeks ago. Ramathuba said that the campaign seeks to encourage departmental executive managers to shift from the tradition of managing through telephones. “Through this campaign, the department wants to get executive managers to be more on the ground, in clinics and hospitals, where almost all health care challenges are, as opposed to spending a lot of time in offices,” said Ramathuba. She has called on office bearers to improve relations with local communities, and by so doing avoid unnecessary social tension. She lashed out at the public servants who do not respect the public they serve. Ramathuba added that people are getting tired of being ignored by those who are supposed to serve them. She had instructed all nurses and officers in the province to wear name tags whenever they are on duty. “We are aware of the nurses that sometimes don't treat patients well. We urge the community members to report such nurses,” she said. Dr Phophi Ramathuba.  Kaizer Nengovhela started writing stories for Limpopo Mirror more than a decade ago, in 2 000.
