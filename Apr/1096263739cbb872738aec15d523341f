News - Date: 20 April 2018 Written by: Andries van Zyl / Viewed: 64 Well-known local businessman, Mr Amin Asvat (60), passed away suddenly on Wednesday, 11 April, after suffering a heart attack at his home. “It was very sudden and a big shock for the family. He wasn’t even ill,” said daughter Amira Asvat. Amin is best remembered for his years as co-owner of AA Furnishers, with brother Ahmed, and more recently as co-owner of A&A Discount Furnishers with wife Ayesha, in Eltivillas. She will continue to run the business. Amin was born and bred in the Soutpansberg, being part of the pioneering families of the region. Amin and Ayesha, together with daughters Amira and Azra, are well-known in Louis Trichardt. “He will be remembered for his friendly smile, his caring nature, big heart and unconditional love towards everybody. My dad always put everyone else first. He was a remarkable man and we will try our best to live up to his values, warmth and kindness,” said Amira. Ayesha, Amira and Azra would like to thank everyone who helped and supported them through this very difficult time, especially their families and friends, both locally and from afar, as well as the doctors and paramedics who assisted them in their time of need. They would also like to thank the community as a whole for the loving support that they have received. The late Mr Amin Asvat (60). Photo supplied.
