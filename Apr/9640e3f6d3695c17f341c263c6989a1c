News - Date: 12 April 2018 Written by: Silas Nduvheni / Viewed: 341 Fighting crime, promoting development and education issues are among the matters the newly installed Chief Erick Mukhesi Tshivhase of Tshidimbini village wants to start addressing at the start on his tenure. He was installed during an event at the chief’s kraal a fortnight ago. He succeeds his late father, Chief Tomboni Tshivhase, who passed away in 2014. During the event, Avhatendi Tshivhase was announced as khadzi, while Galanganzhele Tshivhase is the ndumi. “We find that crime is reportedly high in this village, because there was no legitimate leader after the death of my father. We want to change life for the better for the villagers around. We are ready to bring about development in the village, such as gravelling of the streets and addressing the issues of shortages of water, which are negatively affecting our communities,” said Tshivhase. He added that he did not want to see any children lingering around without going to school, as he regarded education as the key to unlocking all doors. Thovhele Mailasungwa Tshivhase, who conducted the installation, told the new chief to treat his subjects with respect as the chief is the ruler because of the people under him. “We want the new chief to work well with communities and all structures, such as civic organizations and community policing forums, for development in the villages. We want our rural communities to get jobs and young people to take education seriously,” Thovhele Tshivhase said. Some of the khadzi of Tshivhase wear tradtional minwenda clothing, and they bow (u losha) as a symbol of accepting and respecting the new chief, Mukhesi Tshivhase. The newly installed chief of Tshibimbini village, Chief Mukhesi Tshivhase (with black hat) is surounded by makhadzi, makhotsimunene and some community members after his installation as new chief.
