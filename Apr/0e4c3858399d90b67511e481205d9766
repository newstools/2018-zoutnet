BeThatGirl was established in March last year to provide a platform for girls to discuss their problems. The founder of the BeThatGirl, Mpho Mafunise, explained that “in some cases the girls don’t want to speak out, because they are afraid of being judged.” She emphasized that the organisation also helps girls with information on tertiary applications, sanitary towels and other issues a girl child face when growing up. “Growing up for me was not easy. I was helped by others to be where I am today,” she said. “I want to help others girls and tackle the issues we face as girls.” Mafunise said that BeThatGirl last year managed to donate more than 200 sanitary pads to girls and also assisted students to apply at universities and secure financial assistance. The second year nursing student at the Limpopo College of Nursing said that she hopes to see BeThatGirl having its own offices and shelter “with social workers, so that girls can go there when they need help or to talk to someone.” Members of the BeThatGirl organisation photographed after donating sanitary towels to girls.
