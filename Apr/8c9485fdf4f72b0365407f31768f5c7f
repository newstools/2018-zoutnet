News - Date: 19 April 2018 Written by: Elmon Tshikhudo / Viewed: 447 The funeral of Ms Aifheli Mudau (30), better known as Dakalo of Tshitereke Dzungani outside Thohoyandou was an emotional and sombre occasion. The funeral service on a cold and rainy day, was held in a tent at the home of the deceased. It took place last Monday morning before proceeding to the local cemetery where she was buried. Mudau and her lover, Mr Elekanyani Mahwasane (30) of Khubvi, were hijacked at Makonde last month and their charred remains were later found at Matiyani village in Malamulele. Another body believed to be that of one of the robbers was found some metres from the vehicle. Even though it was a working day and raining, many people attended the funeral. The brother of Mudau, Mr Thinawanga Mudau, said he felt like a part of him was removed from his body. “I cannot believe she is gone. Every time my phone rings I just think that I would hear her voice telling me to send money for my children. She was like a mother to my children and I do not know how I will be able to cope without her.” He added that the family need answers and it is only when the criminals are arrested that they will be able to get closure. The casket of the late Dakalo Aifheli Mudau is being taken to her final resting place at Tshitereke.  Elmon Tshikhudo started off as a photographer.
