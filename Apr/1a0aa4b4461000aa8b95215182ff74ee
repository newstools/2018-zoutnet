News - Date: 25 April 2018 Written by: Mbulaheni Ridovhona / Viewed: 423 The University of Venda (Univen) bade farewell to the director of facilities management, Mr Malose Lamola, at the university's council chambers two weeks ago. Mr Lamola was responsible for the growth and development of the university. Mr Lamola said that people had to accept change and that parting was part of change, even if there could be challenges. Mr Lamola added that his departure was rather premature, primarily because of abandoned projects which were yet to be completed. The Deputy Vice-Chancellor Operations, Dr Robert Martin, wished him well in his new endeavours. Dr Martin indicated that he had had the privilege of knowing and working with Mr Lamola for about eight months. He complimented him on the role he played and contributions he made within a very short space of time. “In life, people have the choices to make but at the same time those choices have consequences,” said Univen’s director of human resources, Mr Tshililo Manenzhe. He said that it was not about the time Mr Lamola  had spent at Univen, but about the contributions he had made.

After reading, he would write stories about his rural village, Mamvuka, and submit them to the very newsletter for publication. His deep-rooted love for words and writing saw him register for a Bachelor of Arts in Media Studies at the University of Venda, and joined the Limpopo Mirror team in February 2016 as a journalism intern.
