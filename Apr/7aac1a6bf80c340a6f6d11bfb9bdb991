News - Date: 12 April 2018 Written by: Andries van Zyl / Viewed: 216 With the period for public inspection of the new 2018 to 2023 valuation roll for the Makhado Municipality drawing to a close, the municipality on Tuesday announced that they will extend their office hours to weekends to allow the public extra time to inspect the roll. According to municipal spokesperson Mr Louis Bobodi, members of the public can now also inspect to roll over weekends. This can be done on Saturday, 14 April, and Sunday, 15 April, as well as Saturday, 21 April, and Sunday, 22 April, from 08:00 until 14:00. “Members of the public can inspect the valuation roll at office C027 and at all our regional offices. Objection forms should be returned at the municipality offices on or before 4 May 2018,” said Bobodi. Residents also have the option of inspecting the roll online at the municipality’s website, www.makhado.gov.za. Some users were, however, left frustrated earlier when being met with a “site is under construction” message. The newspaper received numerous complaints regarding this on Monday. By Tuesday morning, the site was still offline. In response to a media enquiry, Bobodi indicated that they were experiencing technical problems with the site, but are working towards a solution. By Tuesday afternoon, the site was up and running again. The Zoutpansberger also collected the data from the valuation roll and combined this in a searchable database.
