News - Date: 07 February 2018 Written by: Silas Nduvheni / Viewed: 1908 The discovery of the badly decomposed body of a 9-year-old boy at Dzimauli-Tshidzati in the Mutale area has sparked widespread outrage. Muneiwa Tshirame (9) was reportedly last seen alive on Thursday, 25 January, at the Tshavhadinida Primary School where he was a student. He was living with his stepfather since the beginning of the year. A concerned family member, Ms Ndivhuwo Nethomboni, visited the house last Wednesday (31 January) to enquire about young Muneiwa. She was shocked when she found his decomposed remains. Muneiwa’s stepfather was not at the house. His school principal, Ms Tshisamphiri Ravhuanzwo, said the school was saddened to learn about Muneiwa’s death. She said the last time Muneiwa attended school he appeared to be sick because he allegedly had fallen from a tree the previous day. “We are still shocked and distressed about the incident that left many learners of the school traumatized. He was still a new learner in our school, and was still busy to make friends in the school,” said Ravhuanzwo. Muneiwa was previously in the Mbaleni Primary School in Sibasa, before his parents’ divorce. The cause of Muneiwa’s death is still unknown at this stage, and is being investigated by the local police. Limpopo police spokesperson Lt-Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe confirmed the incident and said an inquest docket was opened for investigation. There will be a funeral service for Muneiwa this coming Saturday, 10 February, at the Dzimauli-Tshibvumo graveyard. Muneiwa Tshirame (9). Photo supplied. Muneiwa Tshirame (9). Photo supplied.  Email:
