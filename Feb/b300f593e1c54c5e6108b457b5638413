News - Date: 09 February 2018 Written by:  / Viewed: 243 Mr Amos Masete is a 78-year-old pensioner who stays at Bale village within Musina Municipality. He is one of the 200 senior citizens who received food hampers from De Beers Venetia Mine and Musina Municipality last Friday. The handing over was held at Malale community hall. When handing over the food hampers, Musina Mayor Mihloti Muhlope said it was important to take care of senior citizens because they had value in the community. “Senior citizens are our source of knowledge and we should always make sure that they are happy at all times. A community that does not value the elders is like a house that does not have a foundation.” She urged community members to report any form of abuse directed at the elders. “We are aware of incidents where social grants of the elders are misused by their dependants. Some elders are physically abused, and we cannot allow this to continue. The sooner we all report these incidents, the sooner the perpetrators are brought to book.” Mr Hendrik Matjila from the De Beers Venetia Mine said it was always important for them to partner with Musina Municipality to improve the lives of the local people. “We have done a lot to help the local communities as guided by our social labour plans. We will continue to do so because we have the responsibility of ploughing back into the communities we serve.” From left to right during the presentation of hampers are Headman Mikosi Nefolovhodwe, Amos Masete (beneficiary), Musina Chief Whip Cllr Fistos Mafela, Matodzi Ramphabana (beneficiary), Rosina Ramvuvhelo (beneficiary), the Speaker of Musina Municipality, Cllr Gilbert Netshisaulu, Mayor Mihloti Muhlope and Hendrik Matjila from De Beers Venetia Mine.
