During the past almost four decades, Col Luvhengo worked at different police stations around the province. A farewell function was held for him at the Elias Resort, and during this ceremony, Brig Willie Mashaba had a lot of praise for this crime fighter. He said that, under Luvhengo’s tenure as Provincial Detective Commander,  a dramatic drop in the provincial crime statistics had been experienced. Mashaba depicted him as a true and professional policeman, who had dedicated his life to the fight against crime. He described Luvhengo as a valuable asset, whose dedication and work experience would be missed. “He is irreplaceable, but we are happy because he has paved the way and we are enjoying the fruits of his hard labour today. We will always remember him as a father, whose wisdom will always drive us to work hard,” he said. Col Luvhengo said that he was satisfied that he had served his country with dedication and faithfulness. “Although it was not always easy, I persevered until I had paved my way to success. I would also like to thank my former co-workers and subordinates for their support, because I wouldn’t have achieved everything on my own. Above all, I would like to thank God, whose grace has made me what I am to this day,” he said. The Mphephu SAPS station commissioner, Col Dovhani Luvhengo, retired last month.
