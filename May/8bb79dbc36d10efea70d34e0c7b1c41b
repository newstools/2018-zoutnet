News - Date: 04 May 2018 Written by: Silas Nduvheni / Viewed: 167 Ladzani Primary School in the rural Thengwe village outside Mutale is on cloud nine, after it had won the first round of the district’s Baswa Le Meetse Water Project competition. The principal of Ladzani Primary, Ms Emily Phundulu, said that a team comprising 10 learners from her school had entered a competition called Baswa Le Meetse, which is run by the Department of Water and Sanitation. During the competition, learners from primary schools compete against each other in music, drama, praise poetry and poster drawing. According to Phundulu, the district-level competition was held at Tshedza Comprehensive Primary School in Thohoyandou on Friday, a fortnight ago. In the music category, her learners took first position, and in the poster-drawing category, one of the learners, Rotondwa Ndou, ended third. “We are hoping that they will return as winners at provincial level, because they showed that they are dedicated and that they are able to show the importance of taking care of water and sanitation. The programme also promotes the efficient use of water, an awareness of the impact of alien plants on water sources, health and hygiene,” Phundulu said. Mr Thiathu Netshikweta, one of the educators and a project co-ordinator of Baswa Le Meetse, said his learners were more than ready for the provincial competition scheduled to take place on 11 May in Polokwane.
