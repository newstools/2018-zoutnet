The brand ambassador for Future Females is the founder of ROA Inspired Designs, Rebecca Oloo. According Oloo, Future Females is a movement that endeavours to connect, inspire and support current and aspiring female entrepreneurs and intrapreneurs. The aim is to rapidly increase the number of successful women in the country. Oloo added that the organisation strived to create a space where women could prosper. “We want to build the largest and most engaged community of female entrepreneurs and intrapreneurs globally,” said Oloo. Oloo said the title Future Females was in essence a brand that sought to be inclusive in nature. She mentioned that global statistics stated that only 1% of the global wealth was owned by women, yet women in corporate leadership positions had an estimated 65% success rate. Oloo quoted the adage that it takes a community to raise a child. In the same way, the organisation needs to work together with the community to create an equal platform that allows women entrepreneurs to grow. Rebecca concluded that the organisation was more than just a passion to her and her team. “It is a movement that grows to educate, inform and support women. People believe in you, more than you believe in yourself, so why not nurture that in every woman out there?” said Oloo.
