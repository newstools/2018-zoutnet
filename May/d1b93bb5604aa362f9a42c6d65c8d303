News - Date: 10 May 2018 Written by: Silas Nduvheni / Viewed: 839 The police in the Thohoyandou Cluster are appealing to the communities in the Makonde and Matangari villages to help them trace a woman who gave birth and dumped her new baby. The baby’s body was found wrapped in the veld near Makonde-Tshithuthuni last Wednesday (2 May). The child was discovered by some community members who informed the police. The baby’s body was already in a decomposed state at that stage. Police spokesperson Colonel Mashudu Malelo confirmed the incident and said that they had opened a case of concealment of birth. “We have not yet arrested anyone, but we urge women who have domestic problems to rather consult the social workers and various local pastors to get help,” said Colonel Malelo. The local traditional leader of Makonde, Khosi Tshilidzi Ravhura, said he was upset about the incident that had happened in his village and had negatively affected his village’s image. According to Ravhura, the action of giving birth and dumping the baby is strongly opposed by women in his village, because many women long for children, and some eventually adopt children because they cannot have their own. Khosi Ravhura said he did not know whether the shebeens and lodges that had popped up in the area should be blamed for such conduct. “I would be pleased if the mother of the child could be found and be arrested by the police,” he said. Some of the villagers look at the badly decomposed body of the newborn baby that was dumped in the veld near the Makonde-Tshithuthuni village.  Email:
