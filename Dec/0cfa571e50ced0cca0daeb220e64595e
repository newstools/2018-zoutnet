Mr Maluta Mulibana, coordinator for disability rights, said that they wanted all entrepreneurs to comply with the rules and regulation regarding applying for government tenders. “They must not think that, just because they live with disabilities, the government will award them tenders,” said Mulibana. He was speaking at the Khoroni Hotel, after the close of a recent two-day provincial economic indaba for entrepreneurs and businesspeople living with disabilities. The indaba was facilitated by the Department of Economic Development and Tourism and more than 130 people attended it. One of the entrepreneurs who attended the two-day indaba, Mr Humbulani Nengovhela, who is also the presenter of Khari Konane, a programme for disabled people on Phalaphala FM, said the indaba had been an eye opener for him and other people living with disabilities as they had learnt more on how to access funding and market their businesses. “We learned that we should register our businesses with various government departments and SETAs and not just relax, thinking we will be helped because we live with disabilities.”  Some of the enrepreneurs and people living with disabilities, photographed after the business indaba at the Khoroni Hotel in Thohoyandou last Friday.
