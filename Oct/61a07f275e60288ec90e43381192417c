Tshifhango, together with the executive members of council from his office, visited Nndweleni Secondary School at Thononda and Vhusendeka Secondary in Tshivhiludulu last Tuesday before vising Zwithuzwavhudi Secondary at Gondeni La Ha-Mabilu and Khadzinge Secondary at Ha-Makhuvha on Wednesday. He concluded his programme by visiting Lucas Ratshalingwa Secondary in Thenzheni and Vhutavhatsindi Secondary at Makwarani village. During the visits, Tshifhango was also accompanied by representatives from the Department of Education, traditional leadership and ward councillors. During his visits, which targeted a performing school and non-performing school per day, Tshifhango encouraged learners in preparation for their final examinations. He advised the learners that if they passed their exams well they could qualify for bursaries so that they could have a better future. “I came here today to encourage you to study hard, so that you can have a better future armed with education. Unlike us, who did not have bursaries that could help us to further our studies, you have plenty of bursaries to choose from. I am here today to make you aware that you have no excuse for failing to succeed, as you have support all around you.” Tshifhango also encouraged some learners who fell pregnant to accept the challenge and continue working hard to secure their careers.
