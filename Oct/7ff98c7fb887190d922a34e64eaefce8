Cllr Shonisani Sinyosi, mayor of the Makhado Municipality, said the switching on of the electricity was a clear indication that the municipality was committed to providing in the basic needs of the residents. "We want to improve the lives of our residents. We want them to stop using candles and paraffin stoves," she added.

She also condemned criminal acts and advised the criminals to refrain from stealing cables. "When you steal cables, you make someone's life difficult. As residents, don't allow criminals to vandalise this electricity," the mayor said.

Seven people were employed during the electrification period. "We are delighted that some of the local people benefited from the project by getting jobs," she added. On behalf of the community, the local traditional leader, Vhavenda Vho Annanias Mavhunga, said that they were very happy with the electricity. "My people will now be able to watch soapies like Muvhango and Generations in their homes."
