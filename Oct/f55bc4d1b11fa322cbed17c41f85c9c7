News - Date: 13 October 2018 Written by: Silas Nduvheni / Viewed: 505 Villagers in Matavhela and surrounding communities such as Ngalavhani, Mufulwi and Ha-Mabila are taking the government’s thuma mina campaign seriously. The campaign aims to assist the government in fulfilling its mandate to deliver services to the communities. The campaign gained momentum on Saturday when villagers in Matavhela grouped together and fixed and graded the badly damaged road from Ngalavhani, which leads to Tshixwadza in Mutale. A community leader in Matavhela, Mr Tshianeo Netshisaulu, said that when heavy rain fell in the area, the roads were left in a very bad state. “We asked the Thulamela Municipality to supply gravel and we started regraveling with spades and wheelbarrows. We have a programme of maintaining the Mufulwi, Ngalavhani and Ha-Mabila roads, but for our start, we identified Ngalavhani,” said Netshisaulu. Cllr Matodzi Sengani of Thulamela Ward 2 said when communities joined hands with the municipalities and government, life would change for the better. “We encourage community participation in community initiatives, which also help to empower the communities.”  Some of the comnmunity members in Matavhela volunteered to fix the damaged roads.
