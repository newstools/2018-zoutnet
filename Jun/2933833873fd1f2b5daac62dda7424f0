Rambau, Willemse and Lubisi were all found guilty on charges relating to corruption. The trio were charged with corruption and conspiracy to commit corruption, following their arrest during a police trap in February 2010 for allegedly receiving bribes to influence the outcome of criminal cases. The three were not placed in custody following their conviction and they were released. Sentencing was also postponed until 23 October while the court waits for the pre-sentence reports. See next week’s newspaper for a full report on the trial and conviction of the trio.
