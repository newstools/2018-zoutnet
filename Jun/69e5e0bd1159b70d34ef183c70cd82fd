News - Date: 11 June 2018 Written by: Elmon Tshikhudo / Viewed: 117 Police in Vuwani have gone beyond the scope of their work and opened their hearts to a needy family. Last Thursday, they showed their soft hearts and assisted a struggling family at Tshimbupfe Shierfarm, just outside Vuwani. Gogo Mphephu Baloyi, who stays with her two grandchildren and only suvives on a grant, was identified by the local civic leadership as indigent. In handing over the groceries, Capt Thilivhali Mulaudzi said their mandate as police was to fight crime, but they were deeply touched when they learnt about the poverty in which the gogo found herself. "We decided there and then as members to make some contributions and we managed to buy the family these groceries. We hope this will make a difference to the family and sustain them for a while." Mulaudzi further made a plea to other community members and businesses not to sit down whęn others are suffering but to do something to ease their plight. The gogo could not hide her excitement. "We are a very poor family and we are only surviving on a grant, which is not even enough. We are very grateful for what the police have done for us. The food they have given us will sustain us for a while," she said. Mr Musiiwa Mulaudzi, local civic chairperson, praised the police for having taken such an initiative. He said they were most excited that, besides being crime busters, the police had gone the extra mile and asisted the poor family.
