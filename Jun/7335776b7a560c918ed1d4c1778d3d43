News - Date: 04 June 2018 Written by: Tracy Ngobeni / Viewed: 596 Rape has become a cause of huge concern in Limpopo, but a former police chief has come up with a solution that can work towards the decrease in incidents of rape. Dr Azwihangwisi Nelson Mulaudzi recently received a PhD in criminal justice from the Tshwane University of Technology. For his thesis he has conducted a study that can provide a few solutions to the country's rape challenges. In his thesis: The role of alcohol abuse as causative factor of rape cases in Limpopo Province, the Lwamondo-born academic explores the effects of alcohol abuse as a contributory factor to increased rape cases in Limpopo. His study covers social and cultural phenomena that cut across all races and genders. “I adopted a qualitative research methodology and concentrated on the justice crime prevention and security cluster, teachers, lecturers, students, the unemployed, farmers and other professionals. Most participants felt that alcohol abuse was a major cause to rape cases in the province. “The study also revealed a combination of other factors that are largely from the socio-economic, sociotechnological and sociocultural realms as contributory factors," he said. As a solution, Mulaudzi recommended that the liquor board should work hand in hand with the South African Police in the approval of liquor licences. "Policies and legislation permitting liquor boards to grant licences to liquor stores located closer to schools or religious institutions must be monitored," said Mulaudzi. Mulaudzi is a researcher who has published many articles and received a standing ovation when presenting a dissertation, entitled Corruption within the South African Police Service in Limpopo - A Criminological study, for a master's degree at UNISA.
