News - Date: 25 June 2018 Written by: Tracy Ngobeni / Viewed: 960 The family of a patient who went missing from Tshilidzini Hospital a decade ago are still searching for their mother, Mrs Elisa Thonga (65). Thonga was last seen walking out of the psychiatric ward at Tshilidzini Hospital. According to the hospital’s investigation report, she was admitted with mental problems. She was diagnosed with schizophrenia and exhibited suicidal tendencies. Thonga was said to be a suicidal risk and had to be monitored 24 hours a day, according to the instructions given by the doctor who was treating her. The hospital's investigation concluded that she was presumed dead after being missing for 10 years. The Department of Health offered to compensate the family with R30 000, but an agreement could apparently not be reached. Muvhango Thonga, Elisa’s youngest son, said all that the family wanted was to find their mother or her body. The spokesperson for the Limpopo Department of Health, Mr Mill Shikwambane, said the department was working with the police to find the missing patient. Sgt Vuledzani Dathi of Thohoyandou SAPS said the woman had not been found and the police were doing everything possible to find her. The family of Thonga is pleading with the community and anyone who has information that can help to locate Elisa Thonga to contact Muvhango Thonga at 076 791 4424. The missing Mrs Elisa Thonga.
