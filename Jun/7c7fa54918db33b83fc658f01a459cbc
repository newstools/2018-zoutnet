He was born on 23 September1933 at Tshilindi, now known as Mudavula (Malamulele). He was the first-born of Vho- Johannes and Vho-Tshamaano Phophi Mphaphuli. Mphaphuli started his schooling at Tlangelani, but a lack of funds forced him to drop out of school, whereafter he worked on farms in the Levubu area. He later went back to school and continued from Std 3 until he completed Std 6 in 1953. During this time, he was staying with the Mashaba family of Tlangelani, who had adopted him until he had completed his studies as a teacher. He successfully underwent training as a higher primary teacher at Lemana from 1954 to 1955. Right after teacher training, he started teaching at Muswane Primary School as a principal from 1956 until 1968. In 1968, the government intensified its policies of separate development and as he was working in a typically Tsonga area, he was forced to leave Muswane. He was the principal of Sigwavhulimu Senior Primary School from 1968 to 1982. From there he proceeded to be the principal of Matodzi Secondary School at Malonga in the Vuwani area from 1982 until he retired in 1992. He furthered his studies at the University of Venda, pursuing a BA from 1981 to 1983. He was a principal throughout his professional working life. When he was at Muswane, he was a member of the Swiss Mission Presbyterian Church. At Tshimbupfe he joined the Dutch Reformed Church. He switched to Faith Mission Church in 1977. At Thohoyandou, he became a member of the Wesleyan Church. He was a lay preacher, treasurer of the Limpopo Wesleyan District from 2000 to 2008, and was also a signatory of the Wesleyan District, Limpopo. During the time of apartheid, he was detained for 90 days without trial for his political involvement. A memorial service in his honour will be held today (Friday) at the Wesleyan Church Thohoyandou P East at 15:00 and the funeral will be held at the same church tomorrow at 12:00, before proceeding to the family graveyard at Tshilivho Ha Makhuvha.
