He was speaking last Friday during the opening of the annual Provincial House of Traditional Leaders in Polokwane. He also called on the traditional leaders to help in this regard, as the majority of Limpopo Province consists largely of rural areas under the jurisdiction of traditional leaders. “The House of Traditional Leaders and the institution of traditional leadership in its entirety has and continues to play an important role in shaping our democracy and our future. Various provincial administrations since the dawn of democracy have been hard at work to ensure better working relations with the institution of traditional leadership. Working together, we have recorded milestone achievements. The existence of this House is in itself the evidence of the success of our partnership.” he added. Mathabatha congratulated some initiation school owners on the way they have provided admirable leadership in the running and management of safe initiation schools. “Government is happy that you have always been willing to accept advice and partner with us in safeguarding the safety of our children. Over the years, we as government tried our best to offer support to you as traditional leaders to ensure the dignity of the traditional initiation practice,” he added.  Premier Stan Mathabatha.
