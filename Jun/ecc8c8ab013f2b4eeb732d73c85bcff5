Radzilani pipped the MEC for Cooperative Governance, Human Settlements and Traditional Affairs, Jerry Ndou, to the post with 791 votes to 752 during the highly contested elections held in Polokwane over the weekend. Premier Stanley Mathabatha retained his position, uncontested. Mr Soviet Lekganyane beat Mr Lehlogonolo Masoga by 931 to 618 votes as provincial secretary, while Basikopop Makamu beat health MEC Dr Phophi Ramathuba by 894 to 642 votes for the position of deputy secretary. Danny Msiza got 848 votes to beat Charlie Sekoati, who received 688 votes, for the position of provincial treasurer. In his closing remarks at the conference, Pres Cyril Ramaphosa hailed the event as a successful one. He said that he was happy that the elected top five officials were candidates who were coming from different slates. In line with his call for unity, Ramaphosa urged candidates who lost and those who won to work together for the success of the party. Ramaphosa lashed out at the people who tried to stop the conference through a court interdict. He said ANC members should learn to resolve any challenges they had through the structures of the party. Last Saturday, the South Gauteng High Court in Johannesburg ruled that the application was not urgent, a decision that allowed the conference to proceed.
