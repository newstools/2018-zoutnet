News - Date: 19 March 2018 Written by:  / Viewed: 173 The first mayoral imbizo at Gumela took place at the local soccer field last Fiday. Gumela falls under Ward 7 of Musina Municipality and is one of the more than 50 villages that were incorporated into Musina, following the disestablishment of the former Mutale Municipality. Representing Mayor Mihloti Muhlope, Cllr Jeremia Khunwana said it was important for the municipality to go out and interact with community members to address service delivery gaps. He said legislation compelled the government to engage directly with various constituencies to advance the objectives of inclusive governance and effective public participation. Khunwana gave a service-delivery report on projects that the municipality undertook in Ward 7 after the new demarcation process. He said the mayoral imbizo was based on the government’s Batho Pele principles, which advocate to put people first. “As public servants, we all must subscribe to these principles, which include consultation, service standards, access, courtesy, information, openness and transparency, redress and value for money. Although much has been achieved to improve the lives of citizens, there is still a lot to be done to ensure full access to government services by the rural poor.” Stakeholders and departments that did presentations and render services during the imbizo include home affairs, health, correctional services, agriculture, justice, police services, social development, SASSA and the Vhembe District Municipality. Khunwana said issues raised by the community that were a competency of the municipality would be addressed urgently. “Those that are not our responsibility will be forwarded to the relevant stakeholders for urgent attention.” Photographed during the mayoral imbizo at Gumela village are, from left to right, Cllr Jeremia Khunwana, Thovhele Ratshibvumo II Rambuda, Thovhele Mmbangiseni Manenzhe and Musanda Solomon Nduvheni of Ngalavhani village.
